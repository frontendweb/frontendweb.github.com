				<h4>What will a completed website look like?</h4>
				<p>If you want to look at an example of a completed website you can view the source code for this site at: <a href="http://github.com/frontendweb/frontendweb.github.com" target='_blank'>http://github.com/frontendweb/frontendweb.github.com</a>. You can also do the same for anyone elses page following the same url format since all of our pages are public. You can also (in Chrome) right click the page and select "Inspect Element" to look at the source of the page with Chrome's Development tools. Later in the class I'll go into more depth about how to use this tool.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="q2">
				<h4>Why do I get an error when I try to install GitHub?</h4>
				<p>Most likely if you are getting an error while trying to install GitHub, it is because GitHub is blocked by our company firewall. You will not be able to install GitHub or commit to GitHub while on the company network. To do update your site you will have to do it from a home computer.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="q3">
				<h4>Why does GitHub say my username is already taken?</h4>
				<p>GitHub does not currently give you feedback when you've sucessfully created your account. If it's saying your username is already taken after you've already tried to make the account once, it is very likely that you just need to go to the login page and login. If that however doesn't work, your username has been taken and you will have to try another name.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="q4">
				<h4>Why do I get a "commit failed" message when I try to commit?</h4>
				<p>Git requires that you have a username and email filled out to commit. In your GitHub client go to 'tools' in the top right corner and click on 'options'. There you can fill out your information. It is documented in lesson 1's <a href="lesson1.html#install" target="_blank">GitHub Installation Tutorial</a> for your convenience.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="q5">
				<h4>What is this SSH key that GitHub sends me?</h4>
				<p>Git requires you have a valid SSH key to submit code to a repository. It's so that no one else can mess with your code unless you give them a key as well. For our purposes you don't have to worry about this key since your GitHub client will set it up for you automatically (hence the email).</p>
			</section>
			<section id="q6">
				<h4>How do I delete my repository?</h4>
				<p>When you're logged on to your main repository page (in my case <strong>http://github.com/frontendweb/frontendweb.github.com</strong> there should be a <strong>settings</strong> tab on the right side of the page. If you click that, there is a <strong>Delete this repository</strong> button under <strong>The Danger Zone</strong> section of the page. If you click this button and type in the name of your repository you can delete your repository.</p>
				<p class="text-error">WARNING: Deleting your repository is permanent so don't do this unless you are sure about it!</p>
			</section>
			<section id="q7">
				<h4>Why doesn't my GitHub page deploy?</h4>
				<p>Make sure that your repository name is {github-username}.github.com. It will not work if that is not your repository name. If you've done that part correctly and still cannot get to your page to show up, you might have to verify your GitHub email address. If that still does not work, there may be a build issue with your page and you can contact GitHub at their <a href="https://github.com/contact" target='_blank'>contact page</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="q8">
				<h4>Why does my Codecademy lesson fail even when I have the right code submitted?</h4>
				<p>Sometimes it is our fault and that is easily fixed (easy may not be the word you're thinking of!) but sometimes it is the browsers error or Codecademy itself. Code is never perfect, so if you run into one of these issues you can check out the FAQ for that particular lesson or if all else fails, skip it.</p>
